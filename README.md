# 🔥 Vision-Based Early Fire Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **real-time vision-based fire detection system** using camera input and image processing techniques.  
The system focuses on detecting **actual flame characteristics** such as **color, brightness, and temporal persistence**, enabling early fire detection while minimizing false alarms caused by humans, furniture, or other non-fire objects.

An **automated alarm mechanism** is triggered once fire is confirmed and continues to ring until the fire condition is cleared.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🔥 Real-time fire detection using live camera, video, or image input
- 🕯️ Flame-based detection (matchstick, lighter, candle, fire glow)
- 📦 Stable bounding-box visualization (no flickering)
- 🔔 Continuous alarm until fire is extinguished
- 🚫 Reduced false positives using color and temporal analysis
- 💡 Lightweight and cost-effective solution
- 🏭 Suitable for early fire warning systems

## 🧠 Detection Approach
Unlike traditional object detection methods, this system treats **fire as a visual phenomenon rather than an object**.

### Detection Pipeline:
- HSV color analysis for flame-like regions
- Brightness filtering to isolate high-intensity areas
- Temporal consistency to confirm persistent fire
- Region-based visualization for clear interpretation

This approach ensures accurate detection of flames while avoiding incorrect detection of people, furniture, or background objects.
